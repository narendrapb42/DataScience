1)This mini-project uses iris-dataset along with LogisticRegression algo.
2)The accuracy score can be improved using grid search techniques like GridSearchCV
3)Basically, GridSearchCV selects optimal hyperparameters for the regression model
4)Different metrics like F1-Score, accuracy-score and precision can be improved using GridSearchCV.
